Unity Catalog Metastore

The Unity Catalog Metastore is a centralized, account-level "card catalog" for all your data and AI assets across every workspace. 
It provides a single place to govern permissions using SQL, enables seamless data sharing without duplication, and automatically captures data lineage.
This transforms your data lake from a collection of silos into a unified, secure, and trustworthy enterprise data platform

## Photon

Photon is Databricks's proprietary, high-performance query engine, written from the ground up in C++, that completely replaces the standard Spark execution engine. It provides massive speedups for SQL and DataFrame workloads by avoiding the bottlenecks of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and leveraging modern CPU hardware capabilities. It is not a separate product but a "supercharger" you enable on a standard Databracks cluster.
The Core "Why": Attacking the JVM's Weaknesses
Standard Spark runs on the JVM, which has two fundamental performance ceilings that Photon was built to shatter:
The Garbage Collection (GC) Problem: The JVM's automatic memory management, while convenient, causes "Stop-the-World" pauses where your entire application freezes. For big data jobs that create billions of objects, these pauses can last for seconds or minutes, leading to unpredictable and slow performance.
The Object Model Overhead: Standard Spark processes data row-by-row, creating many small Java objects. This is inefficient and puts immense pressure on the GC.
Photon's Three Pillars of Optimization
Native Execution (No JVM, No GC):
What it is: Photon is written in C++ and compiles directly to native machine code, the language the CPU understands.
The Impact: This completely eliminates the JVM and its Garbage Collector. There are no "Stop-the-World" pauses. Performance becomes consistent, predictable, and free from the overhead of Java object models and bytecode interpretation. Photon manages its own memory directly and efficiently.
Columnar Processing:
What it is: Instead of processing data row-by-row, Photon operates on data in a columnar format. It works with large, contiguous blocks of memory containing all the values for a single column (e.g., all prices, all quantities).
The Impact: This dramatically reduces the number of objects to manage and aligns perfectly with how data is often stored (e.g., in Parquet files). It's far more memory-efficient and sets the stage for the final optimization.
Vectorized Execution (SIMD):
What it is: This is the hardware-level magic. Photon is designed to leverage SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions available in modern CPUs.
The Impact: It can load a "vector" of values from a column (e.g., eight prices) into a special CPU register and perform an operation (like an addition or comparison) on all eight values in a single clock cycle. This is exponentially faster than a traditional loop that processes one value at a time. It's true parallelism within a single CPU core.
Practical Nuances & Key Things to Know
When is Photon Used? Photon automatically accelerates parts of a query that are "Photon-native." This includes most common SQL operations: filters, aggregations, joins, and sorts. The Spark UI will show a purple "Photon" label on the query plan for stages that were accelerated.
What is NOT Accelerated?
Python/Scala UDFs: These are a "black box" to Photon. When Spark encounters a UDF, it must "hand off" the execution back to the standard JVM/Python engine, then switch back to Photon afterward. This back-and-forth has overhead, so UDFs can be a significant performance killer on a Photon-enabled cluster. The advice is to always use built-in Spark functions over UDFs.
RDD Operations: Code written using the low-level RDD API is not accelerated by Photon.
Some Streaming Operations: While many parts of Structured Streaming are accelerated (like windowing and aggregations), stateful operations with complex data types might fall back to the standard engine.
Cost vs. Performance: Photon-enabled clusters have a higher DBU (Databricks Unit) consumption rate than standard clusters. However, because they complete jobs so much faster, the total cost of a job is often lower. The shorter runtime more than compensates for the higher hourly rate.
Delta Lake Synergy: Photon is deeply integrated with Delta Lake. It has optimized readers and writers for the Delta format, and its vectorized engine is particularly good at handling the columnar Parquet files that underpin Delta tables.
How to Enable It: It's a simple checkbox ("Use Photon Acceleration") when you create or edit a cluster. There is no code change required to benefit from it.


In summary, Photon provides a massive performance boost by replacing the generic, object-oriented JVM engine with a specialized, native,
columnar engine that speaks the language of modern hardware. Its primary trade-off is a loss of acceleration when using UDFs, 
reinforcing the best practice of using built-in Spark functions whenever possible.


## Catalyst Optimizer


The Catalyst Optimizer is the "brain" of Apache Spark, acting as a sophisticated query compiler that sits between your code and the execution engine. It takes your high-level, declarative queries (written in SQL or the DataFrame API) and automatically transforms them into the most efficient physical execution plan possible. Its primary job is to find the fastest way to get you the answer, often rewriting your query behind the scenes to achieve massive performance gains.

The Core Philosophy: Declarative is Better than Imperative

Catalyst operates on the principle that you should tell Spark what you want, not how to do it. By describing your desired end result, you give Catalyst the freedom to use its intelligence—its built-in rules and cost models—to determine the optimal execution path, a path that is often far more efficient than what a human would write imperatively.

The Four Phases of Optimization (The Journey of a Query)

Analysis:

Goal: To understand your query and validate it.

Process: It takes your code and creates an Unresolved Logical Plan. It then uses the Catalog (e.g., Unity Catalog) to check that all tables and columns exist, resolving them to create a Resolved Logical Plan. If a table or column is not found, the query fails here.

Logical Optimization:

Goal: To apply rule-based optimizations that improve the plan without considering the physical data layout.

Process: It applies a series of powerful, deterministic rules to the logical plan.

Key Rules:

Predicate Pushdown: Moves filter operations as close to the data source as possible to read less data. This is the single most important optimization.

Projection Pruning: Removes any columns from the plan that are not needed for the final result, saving memory and I/O.

Constant Folding: Pre-calculates constant expressions (e.g., price * 1.2) to avoid redundant work on every row.

Physical Planning:

Goal: To convert the optimized logical plan into one or more executable Physical Plans.

Process: This phase considers the "how." For a single logical operation like a Join, it will generate multiple potential physical execution strategies.

Example Strategies for a Join:

Shuffle Sort-Merge Join (The robust, all-purpose strategy).

Shuffle Hash Join (Faster, but more memory-intensive).

Broadcast Hash Join (The fastest, for joining a large table with a small one).

Cost-Based Optimization (CBO):

Goal: To choose the best physical plan from the available options.

Process: Catalyst uses a cost model that leverages statistics about the data (table size, number of rows, column cardinality) to estimate the "cost" (in terms of I/O and CPU) of each physical plan. It then selects the plan with the lowest estimated cost to send to the execution engine. This is how Spark automatically decides to use a Broadcast Hash Join when it sees that one table is small enough.

How It Interacts with the Rest of Spark

Input: Receives commands from the DataFrame API and Spark SQL. Both are converted into the same logical plan, making them equivalent in performance.

Output: The final, Selected Physical Plan is handed to the Tungsten (JVM) or Photon (Native) execution engine.

Tungsten Engine: Uses the plan to perform Whole-Stage Code Generation, creating optimized Java bytecode for execution.

Photon Engine: Uses the plan to execute highly optimized, vectorized operations in native C++.

In essence, Catalyst is the invisible genius that makes Spark both easy to use and remarkably fast. 
It allows users to focus on their business logic while it handles the complex, low-level details of distributed query optimization.



## Jobs & Workflows

A Databricks Job is a declarative workflow engine.

-Declarative: You tell the system what you want the final state to be. "I want Table C to be built. It depends on Table B, which depends on Table A. 
Let me know if it succeeds or fails." You declare the desired outcome and the dependencies, and you let a powerful engine handle the "how."


Deconstruction: The Anatomy of a Job Definition
Let's dissect the core keywords and JSON structure that define a Job. When you use the UI to create a job, 
you are just populating this JSON object behind the scenes. An architect works directly with the JSON.
Core Keywords & Concepts:
name: The human-readable identifier for the job.
tasks: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary is a single unit of work in your workflow. This is the heart of the job definition.
task_key: A unique string name for a task within the job (e.g., ingest_raw_data, transform_to_silver).
depends_on: An array of task_key strings. This is how you build the DAG. 
A task will not start until all the tasks listed in its depends_on array have completed successfully.
notebook_task, spark_python_task, dbt_task, etc.: This object specifies the type of work the task will do and points to the source code (e.g., a notebook path).
new_cluster vs. existing_cluster_id: This is the critical compute choice. 
As we discussed, new_cluster defines an ephemeral Job Cluster (best practice). existing_cluster_id pins the task to an All-Purpose Cluster (use with caution).
schedule: A cron-like object that defines when the job should run automatically. It uses Quartz cron syntax.
email_notifications: An object to configure alerts on on_start, on_success, or on_failure.
max_concurrent_runs: A crucial safety valve. It defines how many instances of this job are allowed to run simultaneously. 
Setting this to 1 is a common pattern for daily ETL jobs to prevent them from running over each other if a run takes longer than 24 hours.
